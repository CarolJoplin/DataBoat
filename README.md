# DataBoat
Database for Rowing Team Data

This program allows for command line interaction with a mySQL database to extract data about individual rowers and their athletic statistics, or team statistics. The queries are written in an attempt to allow coaches and team members to quantify what successful training consists of, and implement successful team-wide training, as well as bolster individual performance.
